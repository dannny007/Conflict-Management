### Creation of remote-repo
- some work done inside 'daniel' branch
- To simply create a branch we will use command 'git branch branchName'
- Then if we want to switch to that branch we will use the command 'git checkout -b branchName'
- Do not forget to always save and commit with the commands 'git add'  then 'git commit -m "update made"
